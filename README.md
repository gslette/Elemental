# Elements
Open source periodic table iOS app.

Initially, all elements will be searchable or selectable from the main page. Once selected, that element's details will be displayed.

# Short Term
- Add a favorites section either at the top of the main page or as a third tab
- Add searching by element family

# Long Term
- Add a tab to select an element directly from a virtual periodic table
